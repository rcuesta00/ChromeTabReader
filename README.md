Playing around with the chrome.tabs API.

The extension reads the title of a tab title changes name. It works only when the tab is on a specific webpage. This site is declared in the .json file (in this case it is Youtube).

Working locally, after it reads the tab title, it will pass this information to a .txt file (I will be using either AJAX or node.js)
